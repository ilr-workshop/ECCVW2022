  title: Few-Shot Learning for Object-Aware Visual Recognition 
  abstract: Few-shot learning has been actively studied for visual recognition tasks such as image classification and semantic segmentation. Existing methods, however, are limited in understanding diverse levels of visual cues and analyzing fine-grained correspondence relations between the query and the support images. This prevents few-shot learning from generalizing to and evaluating on more realistic cases in the wild. In this talk, I will introduce our recent work for object-aware few-shot learning that tackles the challenge by leveraging multi-level feature correlations and high-order convolution/self-attention. I will also present an integrative few-shot learning framework that combines two conventional few-shot learning problems, few-shot classification and segmentation, and generalizes them to more realistic episodes with arbitrary image pairs, where each target class may or may not be present in the query. In experiments, the proposed method shows promising performance on the joint problem of classification and segmentation and also achieves the state of the art on standard few-shot segmentation benchmarks.

  title: Instance-level recognition for self-supervised learning, and vice versa 
  abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) consists in training neural network systems without using any human annotations. In this talk, I will present how instance-level recognition has inspired the recent successful approaches in SSL. Secondly, I will show how self-supervised models can give back to the instance-level recognition community by providing features more suited to tackle challenging image retrieval benchmarks than their class-level supervised counterparts.
