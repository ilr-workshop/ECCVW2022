  title: Searching for Images: Granularity, Compositionality, Interpretability, and Multimodality
  abstract: Visual representation learning has made great progress in recent years. We can reuse models that can map images to a common semantic space with a high degree of accuracy, however, using these representations for searching images among large collections is not enough. When users search for images in their personal image collections, on an e-commerce site, or on the web, they generally search with very different intentions. I will outline here some desirable properties of retrieval models and outline some of our work in instance-level image retrieval with Reranking Transformers (RRTs) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12236), iterative and interpretable retrieval using a Drill-down approach (https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03826), and our more recent work on multilingual and multimodal learning (https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.328, https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15462).

  title: Instance-level recognition for self-supervised learning, and vice versa
  abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) consists in training neural network systems without using any human annotations. In this talk, I will present how instance-level recognition has inspired the recent successful approaches in SSL. Secondly, I will show how self-supervised models can give back to the instance-level recognition community by providing features more suited to tackle challenging image retrieval benchmarks than their class-level supervised counterparts.
